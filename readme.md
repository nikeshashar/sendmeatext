Send Me a Text
===============

## What is it?

A Wix App created during [Wix's London Hackathon], that allows website users to send a text message to the website owner via the website.

## How was it done?

Created over a day and a half (including all night coding) with a team of 5 people, 3 of which contributed to the code: [Nicolas Carey], [Nikesh Ashar] and myself. 

## Which technologies were used?

- Angular.js
- Bower
- [Wix's Javascript SDK]
- Postgres
- DataMapper
- Rspec
- Ruby
- Twilio API
- Sinatra
- Heroku

## My contribution

For 4 to 5 hours I pair-programmed with [Nikesh Ashar] and then spent most of the night coding by myself. I built the backend, including database models, Sinatra server, and integration with Twilio API. Used Heroku to put it online. 


## What did I learn?
- Working as a team with people from very different backgrounds, and who I didn't know before
- Importance of sticking to the bare minimum features for a Hackathon product
- Coding all night can be fun!
